This is a project for a beauty salon website and store that has been built using PHP and MySQL as part of an academic project. 
The project includes a demonstration of CRUD, OOP, and Database connection with PHP and MySQL. It has been divided into sections and folders (Home, Services, Store, and Administrative Section) to make it easier to understand and navigate :) .

The project has a simple UX/UI design, as the main focus and purpose of the project was to demonstrate the structure of PHP. But it has a simple and well done desing and styllization (responsive) XD,
